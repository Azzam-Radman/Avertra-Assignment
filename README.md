# Avertra Assignment Solution
This repo contains my solution to Avertra's Forecasting Assignment.
The solution is based on three notebooks:
- The first [notebook](https://github.com/Azzam-Radman/Avertra-Assignment/blob/main/Notebooks/01%20-%20Exploration%20and%20Preprocessing.ipynb) contains some EDA and preprocessing.
- The second [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/azzamradman/02-model-training) is pretty large and exceeds the allowed file size in GitHub, so I uploaded it to Kaggle. The notebook presents the model development and performance evaluation stages.
- The third [notebook](https://github.com/Azzam-Radman/Avertra-Assignment/blob/main/Notebooks/03%20-%20Results%20and%20Inferenec.ipynb) displays the final results and performs the inference on new data.

In this work, different models are evaluated including:
- MLP
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- GRU
- LSTM
- Linear Regression

Surprisingly, the best performing model is the `Linear Regression` model. This can be attributed to the simplicity of the task that renders complex models less effective.

Finally, insightful visualizations with some interpretations are presented.
